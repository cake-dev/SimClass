    "Pause to note that this is called a *second-order ordinary differential equation*.

Specifically, $f(y,t)$ is a function that accepts values of $\\mathbf{y}$, and returns their derivatives!

For most of our examples, the systems will be *autonomous* or independent of explicit $t$ dependence.\n",

While it's rare that I'm so specific about the required interface to your solutions, you will later learn that if you do it this way, moving to the pre-written ODE solvers will be much easier. The challenging portions are to proper use of function handles, including the function handle for the keyword `method` and the use of `*args` and `**options` (or, often `**kwargs`). Consult Python documentation if you are not familiar with these features of the language.\n",
